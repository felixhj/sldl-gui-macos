## 2024-12-19 16:40 - Naming Standardization

### Modified

- **Standardized app naming**: Changed all instances of "SLDL GUI" to "sldl-gui" (lowercase with hyphen) throughout the codebase
- **Consistent branding**: Updated all references to use the same lowercase naming convention
- **Reduced confusion**: Eliminated mixed case naming that could cause confusion

### Files Updated

- `sldl-gui-macos.py` - Main application file (window title, menu, docstring)
- `build_monterey.sh` - Build script (app name, DMG naming, paths)
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `BUILD_MONTEREY.md` - Build documentation
- `README.md` - User documentation
- `install.sh` - Installation script
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `csv_processor.py` - CSV processing module

### Impact

- Consistent lowercase naming convention throughout the project
- Reduced potential for confusion in file paths and references
- Simplified naming scheme that's easier to remember and type
- All build artifacts now use consistent "sldl-gui" naming

### Technical Details

- App bundle: "sldl-gui.app"
- DMG files: "sldl-gui-{arch}-{os}.dmg"
- Installation path: "~/Applications/sldl-gui/"
- Window title: "sldl-gui"

## 2024-12-19 16:35 - Log Reference Enhancement

### Modified

- **Enhanced workspace rule**: Updated `.cursor/rules/tracking.mdc` to require log reading at the start of every interaction
- **Added proactive log usage**: Rule now requires reading logs before responding to understand project state
- **Added decision guidance**: Rule now specifies using logs to inform decisions and avoid redundant work

### Impact

- Ensures Cursor always has current project context before responding
- Prevents redundant work by checking what has already been done
- Improves efficiency by leveraging existing project knowledge
- Maintains better continuity between development sessions
- Reduces the need to re-read project files for context

### Technical Details

- Rule now has three critical requirements:
  1. Update logs before responding (existing)
  2. Read logs at start of every interaction (new)
  3. Use logs to inform decisions (new)
- This creates a complete feedback loop for project knowledge management
