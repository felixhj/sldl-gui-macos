This rule is for management of logging changes, and updating our project structure log, in order to allow the cursor agents to maintain context, to quickly understand project architecture without repeatedly analysing files, and to inform decisions and avoid repeating work that has already been done.

There are three log files:
/.cursor/logs/changes-scratch.txt
/.cursor/logs/changes.txt
/.cursor/logs/project-structure.txt

**CRITICAL - STEPS FOR USAGE:**

1. ALWAYS read and reference both these logs at the beginning of every user interaction to understand the current project state and recent changes.
2. Update the change log (how to do this explained below) just before you responding to the user with completion status. Include the date and time pulled from the system, type of change, description, and impact for each entry, but keep it very succint.

**EFFICIENT CHANGE LOGGING APPROACH:**

1. Only significant operations should be logged (see below for definitions)
2. Cursor should initially write to /.cursor/logs/changes-scratch.txt
3. Cursor should then run /.cursor/logs/append-changes.sh - this automates the process of adding the change to changes.txt and clearing changes-scratch.txt

**A "significant operation" includes:**

- File creation, deletion, or renaming
- Code modifications that change functionality
- Dependency updates
- Configuration changes
- Build process modifications
- Any change that affects the project structure or behavior
